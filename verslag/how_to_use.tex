All the code neede to generate all the results from this dissertation is available on my github page \url{https://github.com/DavidDevoogdt/Thesis_Tensor_Networks}. The starting points to explore the code are in the readme file.

\subsubsection{Source code structure 1D}

The source code for this project can be found on \href{https://github.com/DavidDevoogdt/Thesis_Tensor_Networks}{github}. The implementation of these types can be found under \path{src/generateMPO.m}. In this class the different types of MPO can be constructed. It bundles some helper functions such as contracting a chain or cycle of MPO's or construction of an exponentiated hamiltonian for the given input hamiltonian. Other examples are making $L_n^{-1}$ by sequential invers MPO contractions,...

\path{src/test.m}  contains the code to create the plots to compare different types and orders. The other files in the folder are self-explanatory.

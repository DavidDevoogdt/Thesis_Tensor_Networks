When the linear blocks are constructed without symmetry considerations, quite some blocks are required. For any one of the 4 legs, the virtual level can range from 1 to M, with M the maximum virtual bond dimension. This results in $(M+1)^4$ blocks. Another possibility is to restrict all equations further by imposing rotation symmetry of the PEPO legs:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rotsympepo}
  \vcenter{ \hbox{\pepob{2}{2}{{"1","1"}}{{"1","1"}}{{
            0,4,
            1,1,
          }} } } =     \vcenter{ \hbox{\pepob{2}{2}{{"1","1"}}{{"1","1"}}{{
            4,0,
            1,1,
          }} } } = \vcenter{ \hbox{\pepob{2}{2}{{"1","1"}}{{"1","1"}}{{
            4,1,
            0,1,
          }} } }= \vcenter{ \hbox{\pepob{2}{2}{{"1","1"}}{{"1","1"}}{{
            0,1,
            4,1,
          }} } }
\end{equation}
In this way, only the blocks unique up to a permutation of the legs need to be solved. More generally, the following rotation symmetry on the PEPO level is imposed
\begin{equation}
  \vcenter{ \hbox{ \pepob{4}{3}{{
            "-","-","-",
            "-","a","c",
            "-","-","-"}}{{
            "-","-",
            "-","-",
            "d","b",
            "-","-"}}{{
            1,1,4,1,
            1,4,12,4,
            1,1,4,1}} }} = \vcenter{ \hbox{ \pepob{4}{3}{{
            "-","-","-",
            "-","b","d",
            "-","-","-"}}{{
            "-","-",
            "-","-",
            "a","c",
            "-","-"}}{{
            1,1,4,1,
            1,4,12,4,
            1,1,4,1}} }} \; .
\end{equation}

Simulating many-body quantum systems is one of the challenges faced by modern Physics. One particular problem is computing the operator $e^{-\beta \hat{H}}$, which is used to compute the partition function of a quantum model.  This function is needed to make prediction about the macroscopic behaviour of quantum systems. Of particular interest are the phase transitions. The dissertation introduces the rich field of tensor networks as a method to perform these calculations. The physics of strongly correlated matter is discussed. The main contribution of this work, the novel cluster expansions, are described, together with the computational tools to solve the equations efficiently. The results are promising. Large imaginary time steps can be taken. Calculating of the phase transition of transversal field Ising model in 2D produces results that can challenge recent developments in literature.

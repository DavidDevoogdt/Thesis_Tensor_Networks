Simulating many-body quantum systems is one of the challenges faced by modern physics. One particular problem is constructing the operator $e^{-\beta \hat{H}}$, which is used to compute the partition function of a quantum models.  This is needed to make predictions about the macroscopic behaviour of quantum systems. Of particular interest are the phase transitions. This dissertation introduces the rich field of Tensor Networks as a method to perform these calculations. The physics of strongly correlated matter is discussed. The main contribution of this work, the novel cluster expansions, are described, together with the computational tools to solve the equations efficiently. The results are promising. Large imaginary time steps can be taken. Calculating phase transitions of the Transverse Field Ising model in 2D produces results that can challenge recent developments in literature.

To deal with these strongly correlated systems, a class of methods called tensor networs were introced.

The Hilbert space grows exponentially with system size.

Want to be able to model various Hamiltonians (e.g. Bosons and
Fermions).
Want to avoid the sign problem of quantum Monte Carlo.
Want to measure physical properties and observables

An introduction to phases of matter, and their surprising structure was discussed. 2 models, namely Heisenberg model and the Ising for different dimensions are discussed. The phases for different dimensions are listed. The last section explained the importance of operator exponentials to understand the physics of these models. Competing \Gls{TN} methods to approximate them numerically were very briefly listed.

Tensor networks were introduced from a practical point of view: what different kinds exist, how to reason and manipulate tensornetwork. Some useful algorithms are discussed. The canonical form of an MPS allows to contract 1D networks fast

The diffuculty of contracting an 2D tensor network was touched upon, and some powerfull algorithms are introduced, in particular VUMPS.

Tensor networks were introduced from a practical point of view: what different kinds exist, how to reason about and manipulate tensor networks. Some useful algorithms are discussed. One of the reasons MPS's are the standard to simulate strongly correlated systems is its successful canonical form as discussed. Another groundbreaking algorithm not discussed here is DMRG, introduced by White. \todo{citation}
The difficulty of contracting an 2D tensor network was touched upon, and some powerful algorithms are introduced, in particular VUMPS. The engineering approach was taken, mainly focussing on the diagrams and not on the mathematical rigour behind them. For VUMPS, the question is raised what the best way is to contract the lower half plane. An untested solution is proposed.

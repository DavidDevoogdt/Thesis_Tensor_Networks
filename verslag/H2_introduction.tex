\Glspl{TN} form a vast subject. This chapter gives a very brief introduction into the field of \Glspl{TN}. First, the graphical notation used to represent these tensors is explained. The most relevant kinds of \Glspl{TN} for this dissertation are introduced. A practical introduction is given how to manipulate these networks. Next, a selected number of \gls{MPS} algorithms are given. The focus will be to understand the intuition behind them, but not to  provide a mathematical rigorous treatment. The next section treats the contraction of infinite dimensional 2D networks. This is chosen both to improve the understanding of \Glspl{TN} through example, and because one of the algorithms, \gls{VUMPS}, will be used in to calculate 2D phase transition later on.

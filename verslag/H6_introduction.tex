This section explains the accuracy and performance of the given cluster expansions. The first section compares the different constructions in 1D based on the error relative to the exact solution. The best algorithm will form the basis for the 2D results. First, similar to 1D, the results will be checked based on the error relative to the exact solution. Then, the expansion is used to calculate the phase diagram of the 2D \Gls{TFI} model.

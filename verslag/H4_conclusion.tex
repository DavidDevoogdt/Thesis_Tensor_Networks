The cluster expansions are introduced here for both 1D and 2D setting. This can be represented with some very compact notation, as explained in \cref{constr:intro:gen}. The best 1D type, namely A, was used as an inspiration for 2D cluster expansion.

For 2D, mainly the linear blocks, loops and single extension will be important in the results. The reason for this will be discussed in \cref{subsec:results:loops_and_ext}.

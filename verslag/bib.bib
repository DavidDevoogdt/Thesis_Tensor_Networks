Tensor networks have proven an important tool in attempting to overcome this difficulty in both the numerical and analytic regimes. These notes form the basis for a seven lecture course, introducing the basics of a range of common tensor networks and algorithms. In particular, we cover: introductory tensor network notation, applications to quantum information, basic properties of matrix product states, a classification of quantum phases using tensor networks, algorithms for finding matrix product states, basic properties of projected entangled pair states, and multiscale entanglement renormalisation ansatz states. The lectures are intended to be generally accessible, although the relevance of many of the examples may be lost on students without a background in many-body physics/quantum information. For each lecture, several problems are given, with worked solutions in an ancillary file.},

First, we introduce a compression method in which the bond dimension scales as D=eO(log22(N/$\epsilon$)) if $\beta$<O(log2N). Second, building on the work of Hastings [M. B. Hastings, Phys. Rev. B 73, 085115 (2006)PRBMDO1098-012110.1103/PhysRevB.73.085115], we derive a polynomial scaling relation, D=(N/$\epsilon$)O($\beta$). This implies that the manifold of PEPS forms an efficient representation of Gibbs states of local quantum Hamiltonians. From those bounds it also follows that ground states can be approximated with D=NO(log2N) whenever the density of states only grows polynomially in the system size. All results hold for any spatial dimension of the lattice.},

While the first case allows large-scale simulations to assess the scaling predictions to a high precision in terms of the known values for the critical exponents at the quantum critical point, for the later case, we extract values of the critical exponents $\nu$ and $\eta$, related to the order parameter fluctuations, which we discuss in relation to other recent estimates from ground-state quantum Monte Carlo calculations as well as analytical approaches.},

We find that at the critical temperature T c the iPEPS correlation length is finite for the computationally accessible values of the iPEPS bond dimension D. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the application of finite correlation length scaling (FCLS), which has been previously used for iPEPS simulations of quantum critical points at T = 0, to obtain precise values of T c and the universal critical exponents. We find that in the vicinity of T c the behavior of observables follows well the one predicted by FCLS.

In this work, we generalize a recently proposed variational uniform matrix product state algorithm for capturing one-dimensional quantum lattices in the thermodynamic limit, to the study of regular two-dimensional tensor networks with a non-trivial unit cell. A key property of the algorithm is a computational effort that scales linearly rather than exponentially in the size of the unit cell.

  abstract      = {Tensor networks have in recent years emerged as the powerful tools for solving the large-scale optimization problems. One of the most popular tensor network is tensor train (TT) decomposition that acts as the building blocks for the complicated tensor networks. However, the TT decomposition highly depends on permutations of tensor dimensions, due to its strictly sequential multilinear products over latent cores, which leads to difficulties in finding the optimal TT representation. In this paper, we introduce a fundamental tensor decomposition model to represent a large dimensional tensor by a circular multilinear products over a sequence of low dimensional cores, which can be graphically interpreted as a cyclic interconnection of 3rd-order tensors, and thus termed as tensor ring (TR) decomposition. The key advantage of TR model is the circular dimensional permutation invariance which is gained by employing the trace operation and treating the latent cores equivalently. TR model can be viewed as a linear combination of TT decompositions, thus obtaining the powerful and generalized representation abilities. For optimization of latent cores, we present four different algorithms based on the sequential SVDs, ALS scheme, and block-wise ALS techniques. Furthermore, the mathematical properties of TR model are investigated, which shows that the basic multilinear algebra can be performed efficiently by using TR representaions and the classical tensor decompositions can be conveniently transformed into the TR representation. Finally, the experiments on both synthetic signals and real-world datasets were conducted to evaluate the performance of different algorithms.},

We discuss the ground-state finite-size scaling properties of three different quantities-the Binder moment ratio, the spin stiffness, and the long-wavelength magnetic susceptibility-which we use to extract the critical value of the coupling ratio g= J J. The individual estimates of gc are consistent provided that subleading finite-size corrections are properly taken into account. For both models, we find that the spin stiffness has the smallest subleading finite-size corrections; in the case of the incomplete bilayer we find that the first subleading correction vanishes or is extremely small. In agreement with predictions, we find that at the critical point the Binder ratio has a universal value and the product of the spin stiffness and the long-wavelength susceptibility scales as 1 L2 with a universal prefactor. Our results for the critical coupling ratios are gc =2.5220 (1) (full bilayer) and gc =1.3888 (1) (incomplete bilayer), which represent improvements of more than an order of magnitude over the previous best estimates. For the correlation length exponent we obtain $\nu$=0.7106 (9), consistent with the expected three-dimensional Heisenberg universality class. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

  abstract  = {Phase transitions and critical phenomena have consistently been among the principal subjects of active studies in statistical physics. The simple act of transforming one state of matter or phase into another, for instance by changing the temperature, has always captivated the curious mind. This book provides an introductory account on the theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena, a subject now recognized to be indispensable for students and researchers from many fields of physics and related disciplines. The first five chapters are very basic and quintessential, and cover standard topics such as mean-field theories, the renormalization group and scaling, universality, and statistical field theory methods. The remaining chapters develop more advanced concepts, including conformal field theory, the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, the effects of randomness, percolation, exactly solvable models, series expansions, duality transformations, and numerical techniques. Moreover, a comprehensive series of appendices expand and clarify several issues not developed in the main text. The important role played by symmetry and topology in understanding the competition between phases and the resulting emergent collective behaviour, giving rise to rigidity and soft elementary excitations, is stressed throughout the book. Serious attempts have been directed toward a self-contained modular approach so that the reader does not have to refer to other sources for supplementary information. Accordingly, most of the concepts and calculations are described in detail, sometimes with additional/auxiliary descriptions given in appendices and exercises. The latter are presented as the topics develop with solutions found at the end of the book, thus giving the text a self-learning character.},

@article{Jaeger1998,
  abstract  = {The first classification of general types of transition between phases of matter, introduced by Paul Ehrenfest in 1933, lies at a crossroads in the thermodynamical study of critical phenomena. It arose following the discovery in 1932 of a suprising new phase transition in liquid helium, the "lambda transition," when W. H. Keesom and coworkers in Leiden, Holland observed a $\lambda$-shaped "jump" discontinuity in the curve giving the temperature dependence of the specific heat of helium at a critical value. This apparent jump led Ehrenfest to introduce a classification of phase transitions on the basis of jumps in derivatives of the free energy function. This classification was immediately applied by A.J. Rutgers to the study of the transition from the normal to superconducting state in metals. Eduard Justi and Max von Laue soon questioned the possibility of its class of "second-order phase transitions" - of which the "lambda transition was believed to be the arche type - but C.J. Goiter and H.B.G. Casimir used an "order parameter to demonstrate their existence in superconductors. As a crossroads of study, the Ehrenfest classification was forced to undergo a slow, adaptive evolution during subsequent decades. During the 1940's the classification was increasingly used in discussions of liquid-gas, order-disorder, paramagnetic-ferromagnetic and normalsuper-conducting phase transitions. Already in 1944 however, Lars Onsager's solution of the Ising model for two-dimensional magnets was seen to possess a derivative with a logarithmic divergence rather than a jump as the critical point was approached. In the 1950's, experiments further revealed the lambda transition in helium to exhibit similar behavior. Rather than being a prime example of an Ehrenfest phase transition, the lambda transition was seen to lie outside the Ehrenfest classification. The Ehrenfest scheme was then extended to include such singularities, most notably by A. Brain Pippard in 1957, with widespread acceptance. During the 1960's these logarithmic infinities were the focus of the investigation of "scaling" by Leo Kadanoff, B. Widom and others. By the 1970s, a radically simplified binary classification of phase transitions into "first-order" and "continuous" transitions was increasingly adopted. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 1998.},

  abstract      = {Perhaps the most important aspect of symmetry in physics is the idea that a state does not need to have the same symmetries as the theory that describes it. This phenomenon is known as spontaneous symmetry breaking. In these lecture notes, starting from a careful definition of symmetry in physics, we introduce symmetry breaking and its consequences. Emphasis is placed on the physics of singular limits, showing the reality of symmetry breaking even in small-sized systems. Topics covered include Nambu-Goldstone modes, quantum corrections, phase transitions, topological defects and gauge fields. We provide many examples from both high energy and condensed matter physics. These notes are suitable for graduate students.},

@article{Franklin2018,
  abstract = {It is commonly claimed that the universality of critical phenomena is explained through particular applications of the renormalization group (RG). This article has three aims: to clarify the structure of the explanation of universality, to discuss the physics of such RG explanations, and to examine the extent to which universality is thus explained. The derivation of critical exponents proceeds via a real-space or a field-theoretic approach to the RG. Building on work by Mainwood, this article argues that these approaches ought to be distinguished: while the field-theoretic approach explains universality, the real-space approach fails to provide an adequate explanation.},

Tensor networks have proven an important tool in attempting to overcome this difficulty in both the numerical and analytic regimes. These notes form the basis for a seven lecture course, introducing the basics of a range of common tensor networks and algorithms. In particular, we cover: introductory tensor network notation, applications to quantum information, basic properties of matrix product states, a classification of quantum phases using tensor networks, algorithms for finding matrix product states, basic properties of projected entangled pair states, and multiscale entanglement renormalisation ansatz states. The lectures are intended to be generally accessible, although the relevance of many of the examples may be lost on students without a background in many-body physics/quantum information. For each lecture, several problems are given, with worked solutions in an ancillary file.},

First, we introduce a compression method in which the bond dimension scales as D=eO(log22(N/$\epsilon$)) if $\beta$<O(log2N). Second, building on the work of Hastings [M. B. Hastings, Phys. Rev. B 73, 085115 (2006)PRBMDO1098-012110.1103/PhysRevB.73.085115], we derive a polynomial scaling relation, D=(N/$\epsilon$)O($\beta$). This implies that the manifold of PEPS forms an efficient representation of Gibbs states of local quantum Hamiltonians. From those bounds it also follows that ground states can be approximated with D=NO(log2N) whenever the density of states only grows polynomially in the system size. All results hold for any spatial dimension of the lattice.},

While the first case allows large-scale simulations to assess the scaling predictions to a high precision in terms of the known values for the critical exponents at the quantum critical point, for the later case, we extract values of the critical exponents $\nu$ and $\eta$, related to the order parameter fluctuations, which we discuss in relation to other recent estimates from ground-state quantum Monte Carlo calculations as well as analytical approaches.},

We find that at the critical temperature T c the iPEPS correlation length is finite for the computationally accessible values of the iPEPS bond dimension D. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the application of finite correlation length scaling (FCLS), which has been previously used for iPEPS simulations of quantum critical points at T = 0, to obtain precise values of T c and the universal critical exponents. We find that in the vicinity of T c the behavior of observables follows well the one predicted by FCLS.

In this work, we generalize a recently proposed variational uniform matrix product state algorithm for capturing one-dimensional quantum lattices in the thermodynamic limit, to the study of regular two-dimensional tensor networks with a non-trivial unit cell. A key property of the algorithm is a computational effort that scales linearly rather than exponentially in the size of the unit cell. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the computation of the classical partition functions of the antiferromagnetic Ising model and interacting dimers on the square lattice, as well as of a quantum doped resonating valence bond state.},

  abstract      = {Tensor networks have in recent years emerged as the powerful tools for solving the large-scale optimization problems. One of the most popular tensor network is tensor train (TT) decomposition that acts as the building blocks for the complicated tensor networks. However, the TT decomposition highly depends on permutations of tensor dimensions, due to its strictly sequential multilinear products over latent cores, which leads to difficulties in finding the optimal TT representation. In this paper, we introduce a fundamental tensor decomposition model to represent a large dimensional tensor by a circular multilinear products over a sequence of low dimensional cores, which can be graphically interpreted as a cyclic interconnection of 3rd-order tensors, and thus termed as tensor ring (TR) decomposition. The key advantage of TR model is the circular dimensional permutation invariance which is gained by employing the trace operation and treating the latent cores equivalently. TR model can be viewed as a linear combination of TT decompositions, thus obtaining the powerful and generalized representation abilities. For optimization of latent cores, we present four different algorithms based on the sequential SVDs, ALS scheme, and block-wise ALS techniques. Furthermore, the mathematical properties of TR model are investigated, which shows that the basic multilinear algebra can be performed efficiently by using TR representaions and the classical tensor decompositions can be conveniently transformed into the TR representation. Finally, the experiments on both synthetic signals and real-world datasets were conducted to evaluate the performance of different algorithms.},

We discuss the ground-state finite-size scaling properties of three different quantities-the Binder moment ratio, the spin stiffness, and the long-wavelength magnetic susceptibility-which we use to extract the critical value of the coupling ratio g= J J. The individual estimates of gc are consistent provided that subleading finite-size corrections are properly taken into account. For both models, we find that the spin stiffness has the smallest subleading finite-size corrections; in the case of the incomplete bilayer we find that the first subleading correction vanishes or is extremely small. In agreement with predictions, we find that at the critical point the Binder ratio has a universal value and the product of the spin stiffness and the long-wavelength susceptibility scales as 1 L2 with a universal prefactor. Our results for the critical coupling ratios are gc =2.5220 (1) (full bilayer) and gc =1.3888 (1) (incomplete bilayer), which represent improvements of more than an order of magnitude over the previous best estimates. For the correlation length exponent we obtain $\nu$=0.7106 (9), consistent with the expected three-dimensional Heisenberg universality class. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

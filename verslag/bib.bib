  abstract = {An extension of the projected entangled-pair states PEPS algorithm to infinite systems, known as the iPEPS algorithm, was recently proposed to compute the ground state of quantum systems on an infinite two dimensional lattice. Here we investigate a modification of the iPEPS algorithm, where the environment is computed using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group CTMRG method, instead of using one-dimensional transfer matrix methods as in the original proposal. We describe a variant of the CTMRG that addresses different directions of the lattice independently, and use it combined with imaginary time evolution to compute the ground state of the two dimensional quantum Ising model. Near criticality, the modified iPEPS algorithm is seen to provide a better estimation of the order parameter and correlators. Understanding the emergent properties of many-body systems is one of the main goals of modern Physics. Projected entangled-pair states PEPS 1 were recently proposed by Ver-straete and Cirac to describe the ground state of finite, inho-mogeneous quantum systems on a two dimensional 2D lattice. A PEPS consists of a two dimensional network of tensors whose coefficients are optimized so as to approximate the ground state of a local Hamiltonian. An extension of the PEPS algorithm to infinite, homogeneous 2D lattices, known as infinite PEPS iPEPS algorithm, 2 was also subsequently developed. As a many-body ansatz, the infinite PEPS had already been discussed by Sierra and Mart{\'{i}}n-Delgado 3 under the name of vertex matrix product ansatz, and had been successfully used by Nishino and Okunishi, 4 under the name of tensor product variational state, to evaluate the partition function of a three-dimensional 3D classical system. In the context of 2D quantum systems, a simplified version of the ansatz, with only three free parameters, had also been used in Ref. 5 prior to the iPEPS algorithm. 2 By considering an evolution in imaginary time, the iPEPS algorithm overcame the stability problems of previous proposals while allowing for the optimization of all the coefficients in the an-satz. Subsequently, ingenious approaches to optimize homogeneous PEPS in finite systems with periodic boundary conditions have also been proposed, such as those in Refs. 6 and 7, where the ansatz is often called tensor product state. So far, algorithms based on the PEPS formalism have provided accurate ground-state properties of several models of spins and hard-core bosons. 1,2,5-13 Importantly, they can address systems beyond the reach of quantum Monte Carlo, such as frustrated antiferromagnets. 12,13 An approximation to the ground state of a local Hamiltonian H with an infinite PEPS is typically obtained either by minimizing the expected value of the energy H or by simulating an evolution in imaginary time e −H 0 , where 0 is some initial state. In either case, the tensors that define the infinite PEPS are optimized iteratively and, in order to properly update a given tensor, one needs to compute its environment: a 2D tensor network that accounts for the rest of the tensors in the ansatz. Unfortunately , computing the environment is hard and an approximation scheme is required. In the case of a homogeneous system, several approximation schemes have been proposed: i One-dimensional 1D) transfer matrix approaches, such as the infinite time-evolving block decimation iTEBD approach 14 used in the original iPEPS algorithm. 2 ii 2D coarse graining approaches based on the tensor entanglement renormalization group TERG. 6,7 iii Corner transfer matrix CTM approaches, such as the corner transfer matrix renormalization group CTMRG algorithm. 15 In this work we explore a modification of the iPEPS algorithm where instead of computing the environment using the iTEBD approach, as originally proposed in Ref. 2, we use the CTMRG. 15 The CTM formalism was originally derived by Baxter 16 and later adapted by Nishino and Okunishi in the CTMRG 15 to numerically compute environments. The goal of this paper is to investigate the performance of CTM approaches to compute environments within the context of the iPEPS algorithm. 2 Specifically, we first describe a versatile variant of the CTMRG, the directional CTM approach, which addresses different directions of the lattice separately, and use it in conjunction with imaginary time evolution to study the 2D quantum Ising model near criticality. Accurate estimates of the critical magnetic field and exponent are obtained. Then we compare the results obtained using the original iPEPS algorithm where the environment was computed using the iTEBD 14 with this new version of the algorithm. The modified iPEPS algorithm is seen to converge significantly faster to the ground state and provide a better characterization of the critical point. 17 Let us consider an infinite PEPS for the state of an infinite 2D lattice L, which for concreteness we take to be a square lattice, with each site labeled by two integers r = x , y and represented by a complex vector space V of dimension d. In the simplest scenario, the infinite PEPS is characterized by a single tensor A that is repeated on all lattice sites. It has components A s udlr , where s labels a local physical basis of Vs =1, ¯ , d and u , d , l , r are bond indices ranging from 1 to D, with D the bond dimension of the infinite PEPS, see Fig. 1a.

Motivated by this observation, we investigate the application of finite correlation length scaling (FCLS), which has been previously used for iPEPS simulations of quantum critical points at T = 0, to obtain precise values of T c and the universal critical exponents. We find that in the vicinity of T c the behavior of observables follows well the one predicted by FCLS.

@article{Jaeger1998,
  abstract  = {The first classification of general types of transition between phases of matter, introduced by Paul Ehrenfest in 1933, lies at a crossroads in the thermodynamical study of critical phenomena. It arose following the discovery in 1932 of a suprising new phase transition in liquid helium, the "lambda transition," when W. H. Keesom and coworkers in Leiden, Holland observed a $\lambda$-shaped "jump" discontinuity in the curve giving the temperature dependence of the specific heat of helium at a critical value. This apparent jump led Ehrenfest to introduce a classification of phase transitions on the basis of jumps in derivatives of the free energy function. This classification was immediately applied by A.J. Rutgers to the study of the transition from the normal to superconducting state in metals. Eduard Justi and Max von Laue soon questioned the possibility of its class of "second-order phase transitions" - of which the "lambda transition was believed to be the arche type - but C.J. Goiter and H.B.G. Casimir used an "order parameter to demonstrate their existence in superconductors. As a crossroads of study, the Ehrenfest classification was forced to undergo a slow, adaptive evolution during subsequent decades. During the 1940's the classification was increasingly used in discussions of liquid-gas, order-disorder, paramagnetic-ferromagnetic and normalsuper-conducting phase transitions. Already in 1944 however, Lars Onsager's solution of the Ising model for two-dimensional magnets was seen to possess a derivative with a logarithmic divergence rather than a jump as the critical point was approached. In the 1950's, experiments further revealed the lambda transition in helium to exhibit similar behavior. Rather than being a prime example of an Ehrenfest phase transition, the lambda transition was seen to lie outside the Ehrenfest classification. The Ehrenfest scheme was then extended to include such singularities, most notably by A. Brain Pippard in 1957, with widespread acceptance. During the 1960's these logarithmic infinities were the focus of the investigation of "scaling" by Leo Kadanoff, B. Widom and others. By the 1970s, a radically simplified binary classification of phase transitions into "first-order" and "continuous" transitions was increasingly adopted. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 1998.},

The simple act of transforming one state of matter or phase into another, for instance by changing the temperature, has always captivated the curious mind. This book provides an introductory account on the theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena, a subject now recognized to be indispensable for students and researchers from many fields of physics and related disciplines. The first five chapters are very basic and quintessential, and cover standard topics such as mean-field theories, the renormalization group and scaling, universality, and statistical field theory methods. The remaining chapters develop more advanced concepts, including conformal field theory, the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, the effects of randomness, percolation, exactly solvable models, series expansions, duality transformations, and numerical techniques. Moreover, a comprehensive series of appendices expand and clarify several issues not developed in the main text. The important role played by symmetry and topology in understanding the competition between phases and the resulting emergent collective behaviour, giving rise to rigidity and soft elementary excitations, is stressed throughout the book. Serious attempts have been directed toward a self-contained modular approach so that the reader does not have to refer to other sources for supplementary information. Accordingly, most of the concepts and calculations are described in detail, sometimes with additional/auxiliary descriptions given in appendices and exercises. The latter are presented as the topics develop with solutions found at the end of the book, thus giving the text a self-learning character.},

During the last few years, numerous new methods have been introduced to evaluate the time evolution of a matrix-product state. Here, we will review and summarize the recent work on this topic as applied to finite quantum systems. We will explain and compare the different methods available to construct a time-evolved matrix-product state, namely the time-evolving block decimation, the MPO WI,II method, the global Krylov method, the local Krylov method and the one- and two-site time-dependent variational principle.

We discuss the ground-state finite-size scaling properties of three different quantities-the Binder moment ratio, the spin stiffness, and the long-wavelength magnetic susceptibility-which we use to extract the critical value of the coupling ratio g= J J. The individual estimates of gc are consistent provided that subleading finite-size corrections are properly taken into account. For both models, we find that the spin stiffness has the smallest subleading finite-size corrections; in the case of the incomplete bilayer we find that the first subleading correction vanishes or is extremely small. In agreement with predictions, we find that at the critical point the Binder ratio has a universal value and the product of the spin stiffness and the long-wavelength susceptibility scales as 1 L2 with a universal prefactor. Our results for the critical coupling ratios are gc =2.5220 (1) (full bilayer) and gc =1.3888 (1) (incomplete bilayer), which represent improvements of more than an order of magnitude over the previous best estimates. For the correlation length exponent we obtain $\nu$=0.7106 (9), consistent with the expected three-dimensional Heisenberg universality class. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

In the effectively one-dimensional representation of a system by matrix product states, long-ranged interactions are necessary to simulate not just many physical interactions but also higher-dimensional problems with short-ranged interactions. Since our method overcomes the restriction to short-ranged Hamiltonians of most existing methods, it proves particularly useful for studying the dynamics of both power-law interacting, one-dimensional systems, such as Coulombic and dipolar systems, and quasi-two-dimensional systems, such as strips or cylinders. First, we benchmark the method by verifying a long-standing theoretical prediction for the dynamical correlation functions of the Haldane-Shastry model. Second, we simulate the time evolution of an expanding cloud of particles in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, a subject of several recent experiments.},

  abstract      = {Tensor networks have in recent years emerged as the powerful tools for solving the large-scale optimization problems. One of the most popular tensor network is tensor train (TT) decomposition that acts as the building blocks for the complicated tensor networks. However, the TT decomposition highly depends on permutations of tensor dimensions, due to its strictly sequential multilinear products over latent cores, which leads to difficulties in finding the optimal TT representation. In this paper, we introduce a fundamental tensor decomposition model to represent a large dimensional tensor by a circular multilinear products over a sequence of low dimensional cores, which can be graphically interpreted as a cyclic interconnection of 3rd-order tensors, and thus termed as tensor ring (TR) decomposition. The key advantage of TR model is the circular dimensional permutation invariance which is gained by employing the trace operation and treating the latent cores equivalently. TR model can be viewed as a linear combination of TT decompositions, thus obtaining the powerful and generalized representation abilities. For optimization of latent cores, we present four different algorithms based on the sequential SVDs, ALS scheme, and block-wise ALS techniques. Furthermore, the mathematical properties of TR model are investigated, which shows that the basic multilinear algebra can be performed efficiently by using TR representaions and the classical tensor decompositions can be conveniently transformed into the TR representation. Finally, the experiments on both synthetic signals and real-world datasets were conducted to evaluate the performance of different algorithms.},

This is defined as the von Neumann entropy SA = -Tr $\rho$Alog$\rho$A corresponding to the reduced density matrix $\rho$A of a subsystem A. For the case of a 1+1-dimensional critical system, whose continuum limit is a conformal field theory with central charge c, we re-derive the result of Holzhey et al when A is a finite interval of length in an infinite system, and extend it to many other cases: finite systems, finite temperatures, and when A consists of an arbitrary number of disjoint intervals. For such a system away from its critical point, when the correlation length $\chi$ is large but finite, we show that SA(c/6)log $\chi$, where is the number of boundary points of A. These results are verified for a free massive field theory, which is also used to confirm a scaling ansatz for the case of finite-size off-critical systems, and for integrable lattice models, such as the Ising and XXZ models, which are solvable by corner transfer matrix methods. Finally the free field results are extended to higher dimensions, and used to motivate a scaling form for the singular part of the entanglement entropy near a quantum phase transition. {\textcopyright}2004 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {I review the mapping from the partition function of a d-dimensional quantum system to that of a d + 1-dimensional classical system and I apply it to several models, in particular the classical 1d Ising, 2d XY, and 3d Ising models. These examples respectively illustrate the general features of the classical/quantum correspondence, a Berry phase term, and the role of gauge constraints. The limitations of the mapping due to the Berry phase term from the quantum side are discussed in the context of the Heisenberg spin chain. Dualities between two physical models serve as an im-portant analytical tool whereby intractable or obscure aspects of one model can be elucidated by more mani-fest aspects of the other model. For example, the holo-graphic principle [1], in which a bulk gravitational theory of a space-time is mapped to a conformal field theory on the boundary of the space-time, has served as a valuable dictionary for both string theorists and condensed mat-ter physicists to extract information of strongly-coupled systems from weakly-coupled gravitational systems. The object of this paper is more down to earth; here I re-view a fairly general procedure allowing one to map the partition function of a d-dimensional quantum system to the partition function of a d + 1-dimensional clas-sical system. This procedure, known as the quantum to classical (QC) mapping, can be used to gain insight into quantum phase transitions from their classical coun-terparts or understand new quantum universality classes from Monte Carlo simulations of the appropriate classical d + 1-dimensional systems [2]. The structure of this paper is as follows. First, I in-troduce the key ideas behind the quantum to classical mapping and claim several general features of the map-ping. These are illustrated explicitly in the next section, in which the 0d (quantum) and 1d (classical) Ising mod-els are mapped to each other. Next, I apply the mapping to the classical 2d XY model and 3d Ising models, and I note how the duality within the latter model maps to a duality within the corresponding quantum model. Fi-nally, I briefly mention further successes of the mapping as well as systems where it fails due to Berry phases. I conclude with a short recap and some harmless specula-tion.},

This open access book aims to explain the tensor network contraction approaches in a systematic way, from the basic definitions to the important applications. This book is also useful to those who apply tensor networks in areas beyond physics, such as machine learning and the big-data analysis. Tensor network originates from the numerical renormalization group approach proposed by K. G. Wilson in 1975. Through a rapid development in the last two decades, tensor network has become a powerful numerical tool that can efficiently simulate a wide range of scientific problems, with particular success in quantum many-body physics. Varieties of tensor network algorithms have been proposed for different problems. However, the connections among different algorithms are not well discussed or reviewed. To fill this gap, this book explains the fundamental concepts and basic ideas that connect and/or unify different strategies of the tensor network contraction algorithms. In addition, some of the recent progresses in dealing with tensor decomposition techniques and quantum simulations are also represented in this book to help the readers to better understand tensor network. This open access book is intended for graduated students, but can also be used as a professional book for researchers in the related fields. To understand most of the contents in the book, only basic knowledge of quantum mechanics and linear algebra is required. In order to fully understand some advanced parts, the reader will need to be familiar with notion of condensed matter physics and quantum information, that however are not necessary to understand the main parts of the book. This book is a good source for non-specialists on quantum physics to understand tensor network algorithms and the related mathematics.},

  abstract      = {The three-body problem, which describes three masses interacting through Newtonian gravity without any restrictions imposed on the initial positions and velocities of these masses, has attracted the attention of many scientists for more than 300 years. In this paper, we present a review of the three-body problem in the context of both historical and modern developments. We describe the general and restricted (circular and elliptic) three-body problems, different analytical and numerical methods of finding solutions, methods for performing stability analysis and searching for periodic orbits and resonances. We apply the results to some interesting problems of celestial mechanics. We also provide a brief presentation of the general and restricted relativistic three-body problems, and discuss their astronomical applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Computational chemistry has become extremely important in the last decade, being widely used in academic and industrial research. Yet there have been few books designed to teach the subject to nonspecialists. Computational Chemistry: Introduction to the Theory and Applications of Molecular and Quantum Mechanics is an invaluable tool for teaching and researchers alike. The book provides an overview of the field, explains the basic underlying theory at a meaningful level that is not beyond beginners, and it gives numerous comparisons of different methods with one another and with experiment. The following concepts are illustrated and their possibilities and limitations are given: - potential energy surfaces; - simple and extended H'ckel methods; - ab initio, AM1 and related semiempirical methods; - density functional theory (DFT). Topics are placed in a historical context, adding interest to them and removing much of their apparently arbitrary aspect. The large number of references, to all significant topics mentioned, should make this book useful not only to undergraduates but also to graduate students and academic and industrial researchers. {\textcopyright} Springer Science-Business Media B.V. 2011.},

Despite this, the essential physics of many of these materials is still not understood and we have no overall perspective on their properties. Moreover, we have very little ability to make predictions in this class of systems. In this manuscript we share our personal views of what the major open problems are in correlated electron systems and we discuss some possible routes to make progress in this rich and fascinating field. This manuscript is the result of the vigorous discussions and deliberations that took place at Johns Hopkins University during a three-day workshop January 27, 28, and 29, 2020 that brought together six senior scientists and 46 more junior scientists. Our hope, is that the topics we have presented will provide inspiration for others working in this field and motivation for the idea that significant progress can be made on very hard problems if we focus our collective energies.},

Its vocabulary consists of qubits and entangled pairs, and the syntax is provided by tensor networks. We review how matrix product states and projected entangled pair states describe many-body wavefunctions in terms of local tensors. These tensors express how the entanglement is routed, act as a novel type of non-local order parameter, and we describe how their symmetries are reflections of the global entanglement patterns in the full system. We will discuss how tensor networks enable the construction of real-space renormalization group flows and fixed points, and examine the entanglement structure of states exhibiting topological quantum order. Finally, we provide a summary of the mathematical results of matrix product states and projected entangled pair states, highlighting the fundamental theorem of matrix product vectors and its applications.},

In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

The first section presents the most important critical exponents and relations, as well as the field-theoretical formalism used in the text. The second section briefly addresses the question of scaling behavior at first-order phase transitions. In Sec. III the author looks at dynamical extensions of basic static classes, showing the effects of mixing dynamics and of percolation. The main body of the review begins in Sec. IV, where genuine, dynamical universality classes specific to nonequilibrium systems are introduced. Section V considers such nonequilibrium classes in coupled, multicomponent systems. Most of the known nonequilibrium transition classes are explored in low dimensions between active and absorbing states of reaction-diffusion-type systems. However, by mapping they can be related to the universal behavior of interface growth models, which are treated in Sec. VI. The review ends with a summary of the classes of absorbing-state and mean-field systems and discusses some possible directions for future research.},

@article{Kadanoff2010,
  abstract      = {This paper looks at the theory underlying the science of materials from the perspectives of physics, the history of science, and the philosophy of science. We are particularly concerned with the development of understanding of the thermodynamic phases of matter. The question is how can matter, ordinary matter, support a diversity of forms. We see this diversity each time we observe ice in contact with liquid water or see water vapor (steam) rise from a pot of heated water. The nature of the phases is brought into the sharpest focus in phase transitions: abrupt changes from one phase to another and hence changes from one behavior to another. This article starts with the development of mean field theory as a basis for a partial understanding of phase transition phenomena. It then goes on to the limitations of mean field theory and the development of very different supplementary understanding through the renormalization group concept. Throughout, the behavior at the phase transition is illuminated by an "extended singularity theorem", which says that a sharp phase transition only occurs in the presence of some sort of infinity in the statistical system. The usual infinity is in the system size. Apparently this result caused some confusion at a 1937 meeting celebrating van der Waals, since mean field theory does not respect this theorem. In contrast, renormalization theories can make use of the theorem. This possibility, in fact, accounts for some of the strengths of renormalization methods in dealing with phase transitions. The paper outlines the different ways phase transition phenomena reflect the effects of this theorem.},

  abstract  = {The theory of critical phenomena in systems at equilibrium is reviewed at an introductory level with special emphasis on the values of the critical point exponents $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$,..., and their interrelations. The experimental observations are surveyed and the analogies between different physical systems - fluids, magnets, superfluids, binary alloys, etc. - are developed phenomenologically. An exact theoretical basis for the analogies follows from the equivalence between classical and quantal 'lattice gases' and the Ising and Heisenberg-Ising magnetic models. General rigorous inequalities for critical exponents at and below Tc are derived. The nature and validity of the 'classical' (phenomenological and mean field) theories are discussed, their predictions being contrasted with the exact results for plane Ising models, which are summarized concisely. Pad{\'{e}} approximant and ratio techniques applied to appropriate series expansions lead to precise critical-point estimates for the three-dimensional Heisenberg and Ising models (tables of data are presented). With this background a critique is presented of recent theoretical ideas: namely, the 'droplet' picture of the critical point and the 'homogeneity' and 'scaling' hypotheses. These lead to a 'law of corresponding states' near a critical point and to relations between the various exponents which suggest that perhaps only two or three exponents might be algebraically independent for any system.},

Some of the dualities are well-known, while others, such as two-dimensional boson-parafermion dualities, are new. The procedure is systematic, independent of specific Hamiltonians, and generalizes to higher dimensions. One important result is a demonstration that spin structures in arbitrary lattice fermion theories can always be simply defined as topological gauge fields whose gauge group is the fermion number parity. This definition agrees with other expected properties of spin structures, and it motivates the introduction of "paraspin structures" that serve the same role in parafermion theories.},

The focus lies on the structure of the cba and on its main results, deferring a detailed treatment of the cba for the general M-particle sector of the xxz model to an appendix. Subsequently the transfer-matrix method is discussed for the six-vertex model, uncovering a relation between that model and the xxz spin chain. Equipped with this background the quantum inverse-scattering method (qism) and algebraic Bethe ansatz (aba) are treated. We emphasize the use of graphical notation for algebraic quantities as well as computations. Finally we turn to quantum integrability in the context of theoretical high-energy physics.

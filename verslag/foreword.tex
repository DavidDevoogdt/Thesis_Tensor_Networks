During the preliminary first meeting, the quantum group promised me if I'd do a master's thesis there, I'd get a challenging subject tailored to my interests. I can say that this has absolutely been the case. The quantum group gave me a taste of real research, and introduced me to many exciting (and for someone with an engineering background sometimes unknown) topics during the Friday "lunch talks".
While this is an individual task, I certainly was not on my own. Firstly I want to thank my supervisors Laurens Vanderstraeten, Frank Verstraete and my counsellor Bram Vanhecke for the interesting discussions and feedback given during the year.
I also want to thank my friends and fellow students with who I spend many memorable nights in Ghent. They made my students years truly unforgettable. Also BEST Ghent deserves a mention, because despite the Covid-19 pandemic, my board year is something I won't forget. But most importantly, I want to thank my parents for giving me the chance to study in the first place.

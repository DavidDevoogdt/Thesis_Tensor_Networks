\subsubsection{graphical notation}
Tensor networks can be written in a graphical notation. The legs f a tensor denote the number of external indices. The upper  Connected legs are summed. Some examples are shown in \cref{tab:grafical_not}

\subsection{Classification}

\paragraph{MPS}

A general quantum state with n sites can be described in a given basis $\ket{i}$ as
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\Psi} = \sum_{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_n } C^{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_n} \ket{i_1} \otimes \ket{i_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes \ket{i_n}
\end{equation}

This requires an exponential number $d^n$ of coefficients C where d is the dimensions of basis $\ket{i}$.

In order to make the problem tractable, the following form is proposed as wavefunction:

\begin{equation}
	C^{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_n} = {C^{1}}_{\alpha_1}^{ i_1} {C^{2}}_{\alpha_1 \alpha_2}^{i_2} \cdots  {C^{n}}_{\alpha_{n-1} }^{i_n}
\end{equation}
Where summation over shared indices is implied. It is always possible to find such an representation by means of matrix decomposition. The summation over $\alpha_i$ are called virtual bond and their dimension is denoted by $\chi$.

	\begin{tikzpicture}[ ]

		\draw (-3,-0) rectangle (1,1)  [add reference=C]   ;
		\node  at (C center) {C};

		\node (N1)  at  (-2.5,-1) {};
		\node (N2)  at  (-1.5,-1) {};
		\node  at  (-.5,-0.5) {...};
		\node  (N3) at  (.5,-1) {};

		\draw    (N1) -- (N1 |-  C south);
		\draw    (N2) -- (N2 |-  C south);
		\draw    (N3) -- (N3 |-  C south);

	\end{tikzpicture}

Explicit translational invariance is given by tensor $C^i_{\alpha \beta }$ that don't depend on the location. The chain is closed by setting $\alpha_n = \alpha_0$. We can now write this as a Trace over matrix products:

\begin{equation}
	\ket{\Psi} = \Tr( C^{i_1} C^{i_2} \cdots C^{i_n}  ) \ket{i_1} \otimes \ket{i_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes \ket{i_n}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{MPO}

In a similar fashion, a Matrix Product Operator (MPO) is of the following form:

\begin{equation} \label{def_mpo}
	\begin{split}
		\hat{O} &= \sum Tr(A^{i_1 j_1} A^{i_2 j_2} \cdots A^{i_n j_n} M) \\
		& \times \ket{i_1}\bra{j_1} \otimes \ket{i_2}\bra{j_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes \ket{i_n}\bra{j_n}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

The matrix M contains the boundary conditions of the operator. Many Hamiltonians can be represented by an MPO. For ins
